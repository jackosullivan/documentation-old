## Repair an OST or PST file
There are a number of tools available online which can repair OST and PST files, however many of these tools are expensive. As a first port of call however, there is a tool included within Outlook called `SCANPST.EXE`.

Detailed information about this tool can be found [Here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253).

In the Outlook install included with Office365, the tool is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16` and can be executed by clicking on it.

The tool performs an 8-stage repair process and so as a result, may take some time.
